# Dotfiles

I get inspired by Dries Vints:

## Before re-install

- Did you commit and push any changes/branches to your git repositories?
- Did you remember to save all important documents from non-iCloud directories?
- Did you save all of your work from apps which aren't synced through iCloud?
- Did you remember to export important data from your local database?
- Did you save your ssh files?

### Installing macOS cleanly

After going to our checklist above and making sure you backed everything up, we're going to cleanly install macOS with the latest release. Follow [this article](https://www.imore.com/how-do-clean-install-macos) to cleanly install the latest macOS version.

### Setting up your Mac

After backing up your old Mac you may now follow these install instructions to setup a new one.

1. Update macOS to the latest version through system preferences
2. Setup an SSH key by using one of the two following methods
   2.1. If you use 1Password, install it with the 1Password [SSH agent](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/get-started/#step-3-turn-on-the-1password-ssh-agent) and sync your SSH keys locally.
   2.2. Otherwise [generate a new public and private SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) by running:

   ```zsh
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flamisz/dotfiles/HEAD/ssh.sh | sh -s "<your-email-address>"
   ```

3. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles` with:

    ```zsh
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:flamisz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```

4. Run the installation with:

    ```zsh
    cd ~/.dotfiles && ./fresh.sh
    ```

5. Start `Herd.app` and run its install process
6. After mackup is synced with your cloud storage, restore preferences by running `mackup restore`
7. Restart your computer to finalize the process

Your Mac is now ready to use!
